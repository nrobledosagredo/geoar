## Overview

GeoAR is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed as part of my thesis project to enhance visitor experiences in the natural areas of the Los RÃ­os Region, Chile. Leveraging augmented reality (AR), GeoAR delivers real-time, interactive information about local biodiversity and ecosystems directly within the mobile browser.

Initially designed for the Botanical Garden at [Austral University of Chile](https://www.uach.cl), GeoAR overlays digital content onto real-world views, facilitating environmental learning during visits. Intuitive 3D navigation arrows guide users through the park, while AR pop-ups provide educational content about nearby species.

## Features

* **Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay:** Displays digital information over real-world views, including location-linked AR pop-ups and 3D navigation.
* **Progressive Web Application (PWA) Implementation:** Operates within a web browser, providing offline functionality and automatic updates.
* **Location-Based Content Activation:** Triggers specific content based on user proximity to designated areas.
* **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implements Firebase for secure user login and data access control.
* **Multilingual and Text-to-Speech Support:** Offers content in multiple languages with text-to-speech functionality.
* **Detailed Flora and Fauna Information:** Includes images, scientific names, and conservation details for local species.
* **Modular Architecture:** Designed for content database modifications to support additional natural areas.
* **User Interaction Tracking:** Collects data on user engagement for analysis and improvement.
* **RESTful API and MongoDB Backend:** Provides data management for user information, geospatial data, and content.

GeoAR integrates augmented reality and location-based technologies to provide information about the natural environment. This project explores the application of digital tools in environmental education within the context of my thesis.
