## 🌟 Overview
[GeoAR](https://geoar-zeta.vercel.app) is a progressive web application (PWA) developed as part of my thesis project to enhance visitor experiences in the natural areas of the Los Ríos Region, Chile. The app uses augmented reality (AR) to present real-time, interactive information about local biodiversity and ecosystems directly in your mobile browser. Initially built for the Botanical Garden at [Austral University of Chile](https://www.uach.cl) (UACh), GeoAR overlays digital content on real-world views, making it easier to learn about the environment during a visit.

The project features simple 3D navigation arrows to guide users through the park and AR pop-ups that offer educational content about nearby species.

## 🔍 Features
