## Overview

GeoAR is an progressive web application (PWA) that enhances the visitor experience in the natural areas of the Los RÃ­os Region, Chile, using augmented reality (AR) to deliver real-time, interactive information about biodiversity and local ecosystems. Initially focused on the Botanical Garden of Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh), GeoAR overlays digital content on the real world, making it accessible directly from mobile browsers. The application guides users through the park with 3D navigation arrows, provides educational content about specific species through geolocated AR pop-ups, and supports accessibility features like multiple languages and text-to-speech. GeoAR is designed to be scalable for other natural parks, promoting sustainable, educational tourism.

## Features

- **Augmented reality (AR)**: Enhances the visitor's interaction with the environment by superimposing real-time digital content, including 3D navigation arrows and informative 3D cards (InfoCards and TreeCards) linked to specific park locations.
- **Progressive web application (PWA)**: Accessible directly via a URL without needing an app store download. It provides offline functionality, automatic updates, and easy installation on devices for a seamless user experience.
- **Geolocation-based interaction**: The app activates specific content when users approach predefined locations in the park, encouraging exploration and engagement with the surroundings.
- **Multilingual support and accessibility**: Offers content in multiple languages and supports text-to-speech, making the app accessible to a broader audience, including users with disabilities.
- **Educational content**: Provides detailed information about plants and other species, conservation statuses, and ecological significance. Includes georeferenced data and multimedia such as images, scientific names, and taxonomies.
- **Modular and scalable architecture**: Designed to easily integrate into other natural areas, allowing for simple adaptation by inserting relevant data into the database.
- **Data analytics**: Tracks user interactions, providing valuable insights into visitor engagement and behavior through interaction logging.
- **Secure and efficient backend**: A RESTful API and MongoDB database ensure secure and fast data management, with a modular structure that supports easy updates and extensions. The backend handles user data, geospatial coordinates, and content management.
